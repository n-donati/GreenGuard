# GreenGuard ðŸŒ±

## Introduction

GreenGuard is an innovative solution designed to address one of the most pressing issues in the agricultural industry: crop disease. By leveraging advanced technologies, GreenGuard aims to prevent plant diseases and promote a quality-based system that enhances business in the agricultural sector.

Our inspiration came from real-world experiences in the agricultural industry, where late disease detection often leads to significant crop losses. According to the Mexican government, around ten thousand tons of crops are lost annually. GreenGuard seeks to mitigate these losses and optimize harvest yields.
